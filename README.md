# ADS Oracle Service

## Short Summary

Service that suggests article of interest to the reader based on their history or based on other readers with similar interestsâ€™ current reads. Also, when articles published in arXiv and by publisher both become available this service advices and scores their similarity for possible merging. These services are mostly for use by ADS.


## Setup (recommended)

    $ virtualenv python
    $ source python/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    $ vim local_config.py # edit, edit

    
## Testing

On your desktop run:

    $ py.test
    

## API


### Make a POST request to get recommendation:

To get recommendation you do a POST request to the endpoint *readhist*:

    https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/readhist

within the POST, payload can have the following optinal prameters `function`, `sort`, `num_docs`, `cutoff_days`, and `top_n_reads`.
* Possible values for parameter `function` are: `similar`, `trending`, `useful`, and `reviews`. Default is `similar`.
* Possible values for parameter `sort` are any sort options, the default is `entry_date`.
* `num_docs` is number of recommendation documents. Default is 5.
* `cutoff_days` is number days going back from today for including published papers. Default is 5.
* `top_n_reads` is number of articles read to consider. Default is 10.

For example payload of, 
 
    {"function": "similar", "sort": "entry_date", "num_docs": 5, "cutoff_days": 5, "top_n_reads": 10}

produces the query and returns:

    {"bibcodes": "...", "query": "(similar(topn(10, reader:<reader>, entry_date desc)) entdate:[NOW-5DAYS TO *])"}

`reader` is a 16-digit anonymous user id that gets extracted from the session id, hence for curl, for this endpoint, use your web API token.

Hence, to call oracle service `/readhist` do

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your web API token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"function": "similar", "sort": "entry_date", "num_docs": 5, "cutoff_days": 5, "top_n_reads": 10}' https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/readhist


### Make a GET request for recommendation with the function and reader params:

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your web API token>" -X GET https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/<function>/<reader>

note that `reader` needs to be known to use the GET, which is extracted from the session id of the POST and returned in the response.


### Make a POST request to get the matched bibcode:

To find match for a publisher paper knowing metadata for arXiv paper and vice versa you do a POST request to the endpoint *matchdoc*

    https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/matchdoc

within the POST, payload should have the following required prameters `abstract` or `title`, with `author` and `year`, and if there is a `doi`, it can be included.
* `abstract` is the abstract of the paper to find a match for.
* `title` is the title of the paper.
* `author` is the list of authors, comma separated.
* `year` is the published year of the paper.

To call oracle service `/matchdoc` do

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"abstract": "<abstract text>", "title": "<title text>", "author": <"comma separated author list">, "year": "<year>", "doi": "doi"}' https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/matchdoc

and the API then responds in JSON with query that was executed and the list of bibcodes with their corresponding confidence, label(matched) (ie, if the system considers the two bibcodes to be a match, 1, or not a match, 0) and similarity scores between the abstract, title, author, and year of the two bibcodes.

    {"query": "...", "match": [{"source_bibcode": "...", "matched_bibcode": "...", "confidence": 0.9140091, "matched": 1, "scores": {"abstract": 0.78, "title": 0.93, "author": 1, "year": 1}}]}


#### Add records to the db (internal use only):

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -X PUT https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/add -d @dataLinksRecordList.json -H "Content-Type: application/json"

where *docMatchRecordList.json* contains data in the format of protobuf structure *DocMatchRecordList*. Please see https://github.com/adsabs/ADSPipelineMsg/blob/master/specs/docmatch.proto for specification. 

Note that *add* endpoint is being called from docmatching script, https://github.com/adsabs/docmatch_scripts/blob/master/to_oracle.py, where a tab delimited text file with 2 bibcode columns and an optional confidence score column in inputted, the data structure is then created and submitted to this endpoint.


#### Delete records to the db (internal use only):

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -X DELETE https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/delete -d @docMatchRecordList.json -H "Content-Type: application/json"


#### Query db:

To query matched documents database, you do a POST request to the endpoint *query*:

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -X POST https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/query
    
and the API then responds in JSON with list of matched bibcodes with their corresponding confidence value.

    {"params": {"rows": 2000, "start": 0, "date_cutoff": "1972-01-01 00:00:00+00:00"}, "results": [["2021arXiv210312030S", "2021CSF...15311505S", 0.9922985], ...]}

Note that the parameters are optional and if omitted then the first 2000 records are returned. To specify a range of records include `start` and `rows`:

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"rows":2, "start":0}' https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/query

Also query can be filtered by recent number of days: 

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"rows":2, "start":0, "days":3}' https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/oracle/query

returning 

    {"params": {"rows": 2, "start": 0, "days": 3, "date_cutoff": "2022-08-25 19:06:15.359667+00:00"}, "results": [...]}

Also Note that there is a limit of number of records per call, 2000, if rows is set to a larger value, still only 2000 records are returned.
